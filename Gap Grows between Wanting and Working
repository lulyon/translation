Gap Grows between Wanting and Working
需求与工作之间的差距增长
It’s a common complaint, perhaps leveled by every generation about the ones that follow: kids nowadays are too materialistic, with their inflated sense of entitlement, and now flat screens and cell phones. Well, turns out this gripe might finally be true. Because today’s adolescents seem to want more in the way of worldly goods than did teens 30 years ago, and they don’t really want to work for it.
这是一种常见的抱怨，或许每一代人都差不多：现在的孩子都太物质了，太自我膨胀了，而现在是平板和手机。当然，最后这一项抱怨应该是准确的。因为今天的青少年似乎比30年前的孩子想要的更多，但是他们却不太想自己去挣。
That’s according to a study published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. [Jean M. Twenge and Tim Kasser, Generational Changes in Materialism and Work Centrality, 1976-2007: Associations With Temporal Changes in Societal Insecurity and Materialistic Role Modeling]
这个结论来自一项研究，该研究发表在 the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. [Jean M. Twenge and Tim Kasser, Generational Changes in Materialism and Work Centrality, 1976-2007: Associations With Temporal Changes in Societal Insecurity and Materialistic Role Modeling]
To do the analysis, researchers turned to a survey that’s been given to about 15,000 high-school seniors every year since 1976. Among other questions, the kids were asked to rate the importance of having “lots of money” and the stuff money can buy, like a house, a new car, or a “motor-powered recreational vehicle.”
为了分析，研究人员进行了自1976年开始对高中生的一项调查。这些调查中，孩子们被问及有钱和钱能买的东西，比如马，新车，或者摩托车的重要性。
Compared to the Baby Boomers that graduated in the ‘70s, Millennial teens place more stock in the trappings of success. And they also express less interest in working hard to obtain what they covet.
相对于婴儿潮时期，新千年的青少年更加重视成功。他们还表示出更少的兴趣去努力工作以获得他们想要的东西。
And can you blame them? In an advertising-heavy consumer economy, why wouldn’t you think that "the good life" involves getting handed the goods?
你能怪他们吗？在一个消费型经济体中，为什么你不会认为好生活就是拥有各种好东西呢？
