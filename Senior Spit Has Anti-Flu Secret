Senior Spit Has Anti-Flu Secret

老人的唾沫里有抗流感的秘密
Seasonal flu typically hits senior citizens harder than most other age groups. In fact, some 90 percent of flu-related deaths are estimated to occur in adults 65 and older. But with pandemic influenzas, like bird or swine flu, it's a different story.
季节性的流感，相比其他人群，通常会更严重的侵袭老人。事实上，90%以上与流感相关的死亡，发生在65岁以上的老人身上。但是对于大流行性流感，比如禽流感来说，就是另外一回事了。
Take the 2009 H1N1 flu. In that outbreak, adults over 65 actually suffered the fewest infections of any age group. That anomaly suggests they might have some sort of built-in immunity. Now researchers say the seniors' secret may be in their spit.
比如2009的H1N1流感。在那次流感爆发时，65以上的老人在所有人群中的感染率是最低的。这也反常的表明，他们可以有某种内在的免疫。现在，研究人员表示，老人免疫的秘密在于他们的唾液。
Researchers sampled saliva from 180 children, adult and elderly volunteers. Then they isolated proteins from the saliva, and tested how well the inhibitory proteins stuck to two strains of H9N2 bird flu.
研究人员采集了180个小孩，成人以及老人志愿者的唾液。然后他们从唾液中分离了蛋白质，并测试了他们的免疫蛋白对H9N2禽流感的抵抗力。
Turns out elderly men and women had significantly more such proteins that interfere with the flu virus—which researchers say could boost the seniors' resistance to bird flu. Those results appear in the Journal of Proteome Research.

The next step, researchers say, is to develop an oral or nasal spray based on these proteins. Which might give people of all ages a chance to send the flu a lethal loogie.
结果发现老人有更多的干扰流感病毒的蛋白质——研究人员声称，它们可以增强老人对禽流感的抵抗力。这些结果发表在the Journal of Proteome Research. [Yannan Qin et al., Age- and Sex-Associated Differences in the Glycopatterns of Human Salivary Glycoproteins and Their Roles against Influenza A Virus] 
下一次，研究人员表示，将会基于折中蛋白质，开发一种口服或鼻吸的喷雾。所有年龄段的人都有机会保护自己免受流感的侵扰。
