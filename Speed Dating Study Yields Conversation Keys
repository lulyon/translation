Speed Dating Study Yields Conversation Keys
快速约会研究催生谈话秘诀
Speed dating is a popular way to find love. But how can you make a good impression in just a few minutes?
快速约会是一种流行的寻找真爱的方式。但是怎么在几分钟之内留下好印象呢？
With scientific analysis, of course. Because a study finds that people can form meaningful relationships quickly as long as they say the right thing and in the right way. The study is in theAmerican Journal of Sociology. [Daniel McFarland, Dan Jurafsky, and Craig M. Rawlings, in press, Making the Connection: Social Bonding in Courtship Situations]
Researchers listened to audio from speed dates and reviewed results from nearly 1,000 dates.
当然是通过科学分析。因为一项研究发现，人们能够建立好关系，只要他们能以对的方式说对的话。研究发表在American Journal of Sociology. [Daniel McFarland, Dan Jurafsky, and Craig M. Rawlings, in press, Making the Connection: Social Bonding in Courtship Situations]
研究人员听了大约1000场快速约会的音频，检查了约会结果。
Women reported a connection with men who used language to indicate that what she was saying was interesting. For example:
如果男人使用语言来表明女人说的话是有趣的，女人和男人最终建立联系。
FEMALE: I played in the orchestra.
MALE: Oh that’s cool.
Daters also clicked if one interrupted the other to convey enthusiasm or interest in what was being said. 
如果一方打断另一方传递热情和兴趣，约会就会失败。
For example:
FEMALE: They ought to just regulate at some point.
MALE:  Exactly.
But things went sour if one participant asked a lot of questions, which women did to keep a lagging conversation going and men used when they had nothing to say.
但是事情会变坏，如果一个参与者问许多问题，女人通常用来使缓慢的谈话继续，或者在男人无话可说时。
The study confirms that people can hit it off with one another in a short amount of time. Just make sure you say all the right things before that buzzer sounds.
研究确认人们可以在很短的时间内与其他人建立联系。仅仅需要在蜂鸣器响之前一直说对的事。
