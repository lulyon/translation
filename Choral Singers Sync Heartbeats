Choral Singers Sync Heartbeats
唱歌同步心跳

Music. It can tug at our hearts. Perhaps even literally. Because when people sing together, theirhearts begin to beat in sync with each other. [Björn Vickhoff et al., Music structure determines heart rate variability of singers]
音乐，可以带动我们的心跳。也许这句话是字面上的意思。因为当人们一起唱歌时，他们的心跳会开始与彼此同步。[Björn Vickhoff et al., Music structure determines heart rate variability of singers]
Researchers monitored the heart rates of 15 teenagers as they produced sounds solo. The participants either hummed one note or sang a hymn while breathing whenever they wanted. They also performed a mantra that required them to breath only at the end of each phrase. Then the exercises were repeated by groups of five subjects all singing at once. And when the subjects performed regular song structures in unison, their heart rates slowed down and sped up at the same time.
研究人员监测了15个少年的在独自发声时的心跳。参与者随自己的呼吸念一段句子或唱一首歌。他们还念一句口头禅，但只在结束时呼吸。这个实验在五组不同的对象上做了五次。当实验对象在一起唱同一首歌时，他们的心跳会同时加快和减慢。
Vocal performances impose set breathing patterns, which regulate and synchronize heartbeats. According to the researchers, choral participation can thus improve well-being. It not only tones the cardiovascular system, but also produces the same relaxing effect as breathing exercises practiced in yoga. So music truly soothes the savage breast—or at least, the heart beating inside it.
发声活动需要强制设定呼吸模式，这些会调整和同步心跳。据研究人员介绍，发声活动可以改善愉悦感。它不仅调和心血管，而且产生像瑜伽一样的放松效果。所以，音乐真的放松了胸腔——至少，放松了心跳。
