Warming Planet Means Bumpier Flights
地球变暖意味着飞行更颠簸
Commercial jets pump out some 700 million tons of CO2 a year—about two percent of global emissions. That jet exhaust helps warm the planet, especially in the Arctic. Which is especially unfortunate for future fliers. Because climate change may stir up more turbulence over the North Atlantic, causing bumpier flights there. That's according to a study in the journal Nature Climate Change. [Paul D. Williams and Manoj M. Joshi,Intensiﬁcation of winter transatlantic aviation turbulence in response to climate change]
商业飞机每年排放7亿吨的二氧化碳——大约是全球总排放的2%。这促进了地球暖化，尤其实在北极圈。这对未来的飞行是不利的。因为气候变化可能在北大西洋周围搅动湍流，导致飞机颠簸。这个结论来自一项研究 in the journal Nature Climate Change. [Paul D. Williams and Manoj M. Joshi,Intensiﬁcation of winter transatlantic aviation turbulence in response to climate change]
Researchers used climate simulations to fast-forward to the year 2050. They fed that future climate data to 21 turbulence-predicting algorithms, focusing on a type called "clear air turbulence," which literally comes out of the blue—pilots can't spot it, and neither can satellites or radar. The models forecast that by mid-century, clear-air turbulence will be more violent, and transatlantic flights will hit it twice as often, especially during the winter.
研究人员使用气候模拟器来快速变化到2050年。他们把未来的气候数据导入21个螺旋桨预测算法，关注一种称为“清洁空气湍流”的类型，这是非常坏的一种——飞行员以及卫星和雷达都不能识别它。该模型预测了到世纪中叶， 清洁空气湍流会更强烈，跨大西洋的飞行会遇到两倍以上的颠簸，尤其是在冬天。
Beyond spilling drinks, severe clear-air turbulence can injure or kill passengers, and damage planes, too—it once ripped an engine off a DC-8. The researchers say airlines may have to fly more detours in the future to avoid it, a waste of time and fuel that ups emissions. Which could mean higher ticket prices, and even less friendly skies.
除了弄洒饮料，严重的清洁空气湍流会造成乘客伤亡，并且破坏飞机。它曾经有一次扒掉了DC-8飞机的引擎。研究人员表示，以后航线可能必须要更曲折才能避免颠簸，会浪费时间和原料。也就意味着票价更大，飞行风险更大。
