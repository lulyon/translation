Passionate Appearance Enhances Musical Performance
热情的外表促进音乐表演
Classical music competitions pit performers against each other. Obviously, the most important criterion for judges is sound. But that assumption needs a new…hearing. Because a player’s passion may be the best predictor of victory.
古典音乐比赛现场，表演人相互竞争。显然，对评审来说最重要的标准是声音。但是这个假设需要不同的意见。因为选手的热情可能是最好的预测输赢的指标。
In a new study, nearly 200 novices had to choose the winners of 10 classical music competitions. Some heard a music clip of the top three performances. Others saw a video with sound. Still others watched a silent video. And the participants were more likely to choose the winner if they watched the silent video, in all 10 of the competitions.
在一项新的研究中，大约200名新手需要在10名古典音乐比赛者中选择胜出者。有些人听三个最好的表演者的音乐录音片段。有些人看视频。有些人看静音视频。参与者倾向于选择静音视频中的表演者。
Then professional musicians gave it a try. These judges also only reliably selected the winners from the silent video. Musicians selected the winner more frequently even when all they saw was an outline of the motion of the performers.
专业的音乐人也尝试了一番。这些评审也只依赖于静音视频来选择胜出者。音乐人比新手倾向于选择静音视频中的表演者的比例更大。
The researchers say the findings show that novices and experts make quick judgments about musical performances based on visual cues conveying involvement and passion. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. [Chia-Jung Tsay, Sight over sound in the judgment of music]
研究人员表示，这个发现表明新手和专家对传递热情的表演会很快作出判断。该研究发表在Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. [Chia-Jung Tsay, Sight over sound in the judgment of music]

So next time you see a live concert, don’t close your eyes to focus on the music. You might be missing the most important part.
所以下次当你观看现场音乐会时，不要闭上眼镜只欣赏音乐。你可能错过了最重要的部分。
