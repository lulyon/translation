Big Social Group Makes Lemurs Cannier
大社交圈使得狐猴更精明
Good news for big-time networking primates: other primates that live in large social groups have more street smarts than their comrades with smaller social circles. So finds a study in the journalPLoS ONE. [Evan L. MacLean et al., Group Size Predicts Social but Not Nonsocial Cognition in Lemurs] 
擅长社交的灵长目动物的好消息：社交圈更大的灵长目动物比社交圈小的动物更精明。这个结论来自一项研究 the journalPLoS ONE. [Evan L. MacLean et al., Group Size Predicts Social but Not Nonsocial Cognition in Lemurs] 
Researchers tested the circumstances under which lemurs would pilfer food from people. The study included ring-tailed lemurs, which come from large social groups, as well as lemurs from small-groups, like the mongoose lemur. The lemurs all had the same brain size, so would be presumed to have similar raw intelligence. 
研究人员测试了狐猴以偷人的东西为生的环境。研究包括来自大社交圈的 ring-tailed lemurs, 以及来自小社交圈的mongoose lemur. 这些狐猴的大脑体积相同，所以可以假设他们智力水平相当。
Humans sat in a room with either a plate of food on the table in front of them or behind them. A third group of people was blindfolded, with the plate in front of them. 
人坐在一间屋子里，在他们前面或后面放着一盘食物。三分之一的人被蒙面了，食物放在他们前面。
Lemurs from large social groups tended to steal the food if the person’s back was to it. Lemurs from smaller social groups went for the food as frequently regardless of its position. And no lemurs appeared to understand the purpose of a blindfold.
大社交圈的狐猴倾向于偷人们后面的食物。小社交圈的狐猴则频繁的偷食物，而不管食物的位置。没有狐猴理解人类蒙面的目的。
The researchers interpret the results as showing that social factors can influence a species’ smarts. So you could be outwitted by a birdbrain, if he has a lot of friends.
研究人员解释结果，认为社交因素可以影响物种的智慧。所以你可能会被一个愚笨的人打败，如果他有很多朋友的话。
