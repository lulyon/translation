Video Game Play Sharpens Elderly Minds
玩电脑游戏使老人大脑敏锐
Wanna help grandma keep her mind sharp? Consider throwing out her crossword puzzles and giving her a joystick. Because a study finds that elderly people who played a video game for at least 10 hours gained three years of protection from cognitive decline. Gamers also became quicker at processing information. The research is in the journal PLoS ONE. [Fredric D. Wolinsky et al., A Randomized Controlled Trial of Cognitive Training Using a Visual Speed of Processing Intervention in Middle Aged and Older Adults]
想要帮助奶奶保持大脑灵活吗？考虑放弃拼字游戏，给她一个游戏手柄吧。因为一项研究发现玩10小时游戏的老人能够把认知衰退延迟三年。游戏者还可以在处理信息时变得更快。研究发表在the journal PLoS ONE. [Fredric D. Wolinsky et al., A Randomized Controlled Trial of Cognitive Training Using a Visual Speed of Processing Intervention in Middle Aged and Older Adults]
Almost 700 subjects were divided into two groups: those between the ages of fifty and sixty-four and people aged sixty-five and older. Members from each age group were asked to either work on a crossword puzzle or play a video game called Road Tour, which involves matching fleeting images of car types and road signs.
近700个实验对象分成两组：50-64岁以及65岁以上。每组成员要么玩拼字游戏，要么玩一款叫Road Tour的 电脑游戏，这款游戏会匹配车的类型和路的标志。
In both age groups, those who played the video game showed improvements on executive function—which includes memory, attention, problem solving skills and perception—when tested a year later.
在两组中，那些玩电脑游戏的人一年以内在执行任务时表现出改善——包括记忆，注意力，解决问题的能力和认知能力。
Some of the gamers were given four additional hours of training with the game. And their cognitive improvement lasted an additional year. So video games might help ward off cognitive decline. Just don’t play Road Tour while actually driving.
有些游戏者进行四小时的游戏训练。他们的认知一年以后也得到了改善。所以电脑游戏可能会帮助改善认知衰退。当然，可别在开车的时候玩Road Tour呀。
