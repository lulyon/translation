Video Job Interview May Weaken Your Chances
视频工作面试可能降低你的工作机会
If you're applying for a job a couple thousand miles away, a Skype interview will certainly be cheaper than meeting in person. But it could end up costing you the job. Because a study finds that a video chat can make you seem less likeable than a face-to-face interview would.
如果你在千里之外应聘一个职位，Skype面试当然是比面对面更便宜的面试方式。但是代价可能是你的工作机会。因为一项研究发现，视频聊天相比面对面交流，使你更不容易受到青睐。
Researchers recruited 104 MBA students, most of whom had about five years' work experience. Half the students acted as job candidates for a position at a fictional company; the other half served as interviewers. Each candidate interviewed both in person and via video chat.
研究人员召集了104位MBA学生，大部分人有五年工作经验。半数学生作为候选者应聘一个虚拟公司的职位；另一半的学生作为面试者。每个候选者以面对面和视频聊天两种方式参与面试。
Turns out, job seekers on video were rated as less likeable, and were less likely to be recommended for the job.
结果，应聘者以视频方式面试时，得到的评分更少，更不可能被推荐到相应的工作。
And it's not just the interviewees who got worse scores with video. Interviewers themselves were judged as less personable, competent and trustworthy. Even less attractive. The results appear in the journal Management Decision. [Greg J. Sears et al., A Comparative Assessment of Videoconference and Face-to- Face Employment Interviews]

It's harder to telegraph emotions and maintain eye contact during a video chat. So if Skype's your only option, the researchers recommend positioning your webcam as close to eye level as possible, and being more expressive than usual—it might land you some actual FaceTime down the line.
在视频聊天过程中，很难传达情感和维持眼神交流。所以如果Skype是你的选择，研究人员推荐把摄像头放在离眼镜尽可能近的地方，增加表现力——这可能会帮助你传达面对面交流的感觉。
