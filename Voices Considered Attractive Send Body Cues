Voices Considered Attractive Send Body Cues
有吸引力的声音发送身体暗示
What makes someone sound sexy? To get a scientific viewpoint, researchers gauged volunteers' responses to different voices. The conclusion: voices considered attractive send messages about body size. The work is in the journal PLoS ONE. [Yi Xu et al., Human Vocal Attractiveness as Signaled by Body Size Projection]

In the animal kingdom, sound indicates size and intentions. For example, a rough and low-frequency call suggests the vocalizer is large and aggressive, while a clearer, higher frequency signals a small, nonthreatening animal.
在动物世界，声音暗示大小和意图。比如，粗犷而低频率的声音表明发声者大而富侵略性，而清脆而高频的声音表明发声者小巧而无威胁。
In the study, researchers adjusted a variety of voices to correspond with different body sizes. To do so, they synthesized completely artificial voices, and recorded sentences before varying the pitches and resonance.
在这项研究中，研究人员调整一系列的声音到不同的身体大小。为了做到这些，他们合成了完全人工的声音，记录片段，然后改变场地和回声。
When volunteers listened to the sound samples, men preferred higher-pitched female voices like this one [voice clip], which suggest a smaller body size. Low-frequency male voices that signaled a large body size [voice clip], were attractive to females.
当志愿者听声音样本时，男性偏爱声音较尖的女性声音，这种声音暗示较小的体型。低频的男性声音，暗示体型较大，对女性有吸引力。
Interestingly, breathiness made both male and female voices more desirable. It certainly explains the enduring popularity of [audio of Marilyn Monroe singing to JFK].
有趣的是，喘息声使得男女的声音都更有吸引力。这也解释了Marilyn Monroe 的歌声和JFK的持续的名气
