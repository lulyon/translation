Poker Players' Arms Give Away Their Hands
扑克玩家的手臂会泄露他们的秘密
A good “poker face” can hide the quality of your cards. But your arms might still be giving away your hands. That’s the finding of a study to come out in the journal Psychological Science.

一张好的“扑克脸”可以隐藏你手中牌的质量。但是你的手臂也许还是会泄露秘密。这个结论来自一项研究the journal Psychological Science. [Michael L. Slepian et al., Quality of Professional Players’ Poker Hands is Perceived Accurately from Arm Motions, link to come]
Volunteers watched videos of the World Series of Poker. The videos were edited so the subjects saw one of three different views of the players: the poker players’ entire bodies from the table up, or just the players’ faces or just the players’ arms pushing chips into the pot. “When participants were watching chips being pushed into the center of the table by the players, it was only then could they accurately perceive how good a hand was better than chance. They couldn’t do it for the whole body and if anything they were worse from just watching the face.” Michael Slepian, a psychology doctoral student at Stanford University, and a co-author of the study.
志愿者观看了扑克世界系列赛的视频。视频经过了剪辑使得对象可以从三个不同角度看实验对象：扑克玩家桌面以上整个身体，玩家的脸部，或者只有玩家的手臂。”当参与者观看玩家用手插牌时，他们通过看手臂可以精确的知道牌的好坏程度。但是他们看整个身体或者脸的话是不行的。” 斯坦福大学的心理学博士生 Michael Slepian以及他的合作者表示。
No pros were among the video watchers. But there’s some evidence that, as might be expected, they’d be even better at catching arm cues. “In one of our studies, the more participants were familiar with poker—even though they were all novices—the better they did.”
这些视频观看者中并没有专业人士。但是一些证据表明，他们看手臂会得到更好的启发。“在我们的一项研究中，参与者越熟悉扑克——即使他们是新手——他们也会表现的更好。”
