Group Finds Big Feet Fine
有的人群崇尚大脚
All humans evolved to find certain female traits attractive, across cultures, because they signal a potential mate's reproductive potential. Right? Actually, a new study finds that cultural norms can also play a big part. At least when it comes to big feet.
所有的人类，无论文化，都进化到了喜欢特定的女性特征，因为他们表明了潜在伴侣的繁殖潜力。对吗？实际上，一项新的研究表明，文化习惯在其中发挥着很大的影响。至少在关于大脚的话题上是这样。
Once women give birth, their feet tend to grow larger. Which means small feet are markers for youth and fertility, and thus should be universally attractive. A previous study did find a widespread small-foot preference. But University of Washington anthropologist Geoff Kushnick tested the hypothesis again among rural Indonesians called the Karo Batak.
一旦女人生产，她们的脚就会变大。这就意味着小脚是年轻和生育能力的标志。但是华盛顿大学的人类学家 Geoff Kushnick在印尼偏远郊区Karo Batak 重新评测了这项假设。
One hundred fifty-nine men and women looked at a series of female figures, identical except for subtly different foot sizes. Surprisingly, the Karo Batak rated the image with the largest feet the most attractive. The work is in the journal Human Nature. [Geoff Kushnick, Why Do the Karo Batak Prefer Women with Big Feet?]
159个男人和女人查看一系列女人的照片，所有都一样除了不同的脚的尺寸。令人惊讶的是，这里的人认为脚最大的女人最有吸引力。这项工作发表在The work is in the journal Human Nature. [Geoff Kushnick, Why Do the Karo Batak Prefer Women with Big Feet?]
Among the Karo Batak, and other rural societies with low exposure to media, large feet are signs of a woman's strength and ability to do agricultural work. This cultural big foot bias contradicts the notion of universal ideals of beauty. Attractiveness is not one size fits all.
在Karo Batak, 以及其他远离媒体的偏远社区，大脚是女人强壮和能干农活的象征。这种文化大脚偏爱与一般普遍的审美想矛盾。吸引力并不是一刀切。
