Ecotourism Can Be Animals' Pet Peeve
生态旅游可能对动物不利
Some ecotourism offers visitors close encounters with different species. But new research suggests that these activities may not be so great for theanimals.
有些生态旅游给旅游者近距离接触不同物种的机会。但是一项新的研究表明，这些活动对动物来说，未必有益。
Researchers tagged stingrays in Stingray City in the Cayman Islands to monitor their movements and behavior. Compared to stingrays outside of the tourism area, those in Stingray City switched their activity patterns from night to day, when tourists handed out food, and mated year round instead of seasonally. The  stingrays also had more bite marks, which suggests increased aggression towards one another. The study is in the journal PLoS ONE. [Mark J.

研究人员关注了Stingray City in the Cayman Islands 地区的黄貂鱼来检测他们的移动和行为。相比旅游区之外的黄貂鱼，他们的活动模式从晚上转变到白天，这时游客会散发食物，并且全年而非季节性求偶。 它们还有更多的被咬的痕迹，这意味着它们增加了对同类的攻击性。研究发表在the journal PLoS ONE. [Mark J.

Past research has found increased stress and more intra- and inter-species aggression among animals that have been fed by humans.
过去的研究发现，人类喂养的动物，增加了压力和种群内外的攻击性。
Interactive tourism is a growing business. But researchers say that more study is needed to ensure the health and safety of humans and animals alike. Ecotourism may be good for a given species, as humans become engaged in its survival. But for the individual members of that species tasked with dealing with people, it may not be a walk in the park.
交互式旅游是一个持续增长的行业。但研究人员表明，需要更多的研究来确保人和动物的安全与健康。生态旅游可能对特定种群是好事，因为人类参与它们的生存繁衍。但是这些种群的一些成员必须负责与人打交道，这可不像在公园散步。
