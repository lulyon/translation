U.S. Marriage Rates Keep Declining
美国结婚率持续下降
If you haven't already picked up on the trend from all the whining on Bravo’s Princesses: Long Island, marriage rates in America are at an all-time low. And the median age at which women do say "I do" is now 27, the highest it's been in a century. That's according to a new report by Bowling Green State University’s Julissa Cruz, published by the National Center for Family and Marriage Research.

如果你还没有跟上 Bravo’s Princesses: Long Island抱怨的潮流，美国的结婚率正在前所未有的低。女人说“我愿意”的平均年龄是27岁，近一个世纪以来最高。这来源于一则新闻报道by Bowling Green State University’s Julissa Cruz, published by the National Center for Family and Marriage Research. [Julissa Cruz, Marriage: More Than a Century of Change]
In the 1920s, 92 women walked down the aisle each year per 1000 single women of marrying age. Today, it's a third that. Marriage rates were expected to plateau in the wake of the baby boom, but so far they just keep dropping.
在1920年代，适婚年龄单身女性1000位中每年有92位走进婚姻殿堂。现在只有三分之一。由于婴儿潮的原因，人们认为结婚率会上升，但是目前为止，他们还是一直都在下降。
Apparently, many college-educated women are simply putting off getting hitched, and many black women might be foregoing it altogether. Because while every ethnic group has seen a drop in the proportion of married women since the '50s, it's dipped lowest for black women—just 26 percent of whom are married.
显然，许多受过高等教育的女性会推迟结婚年龄，而许多黑人女性会走在前面。因为虽然有些族群在50年代之后结婚率有所下降，黑人女性下降得最多——只有26%已婚。
In the U.K. and most of Europe, the average age for women tying the knot is already more than 30. And if Long Island’s reality stars are an indicator, we're soon to follow.
在英国，以及大部分的欧洲，女性的平均结婚年龄已经超过30岁。如果长岛的现状是一个指标的话，我们很快也会达到这个水平。
