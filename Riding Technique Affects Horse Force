Riding Technique Affects Horse Force
骑马技术影响马力
It’s tough to have a job where the boss is always riding you. That’s literally the case with a horse. Now a study finds that stress experienced by the equine spine can vary drastically with the style and skill of the rider. The findings are trotted out in the Journal of Experimental Biology.

做工作很难，如果老板一直对你颐指气使。对马来说，确实就是这样的。一项研究发现，马刺施加的压力，由于不同的骑马者的风格和技巧，有很大的不同。研究发表在 the Journal of Experimental Biology. [Patricia de Cocq et al., Modelling biomechanical requirements of a rider for different horse-riding techniques at trot]

Your average riders have two basic choices when it comes to staying on a moving steed. They can clamp their thighs tight and try to remain seated, or they can bob up and down with the rhythm of the horse, standing in the stirrups as they rise off the saddle. But which is better for the horse?
普通的骑马者在保持移动速度时有两种基本的选择。他们可以夹住双腿，保持坐姿，或者可以随着马的节奏上下摆动，站在马蹬上。但是，对马来说，哪种姿势更好呢？
Researchers filmed dressage riders as they trotted using both techniques. And they found that riders who use the more bouncy ‘rising trot’ actually keep their center of mass more steady when they stand—which reduces the force on the horse’s back.
研究人员录制了盛装舞步骑手使用两种方法骑马的录像。他们发现使用更有弹性的上下摆动的姿势会使他们质心更稳——并且减少在马背上的负重。
Now, jockeys take this position to the extreme. By standing in the stirrups for the entire ride, a jockey’s center of mass follows an almost flat line. Makes for a faster race to the finish, and a less burdened beast.
如今，赛马骑师把这方法用到了极致。通过在骑马全程中都站在马蹬上，赛马骑师可以保持质心几乎在水平线上。这样使得冲刺速度更快，而马的负担最小。
