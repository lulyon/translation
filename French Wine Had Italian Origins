French Wine Had Italian Origins
法国酒源于意大利
France considers itself the world center of wine. But there may be some red faces in Burgundy today—because a study provides more evidence that the techniques for turning grapes into a glass of wine may have come over from what today is Italy. The research is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. [Patrick E. McGovern,Beginning of viniculture in France]

Archaeologists have found containers, called amphoras, at sites along the French coast. The 2,500-year-old vessels had characteristics of wine bottles used by the Etruscans in what’s now Italy. But did these amphoras actually contain wine?
考古学家在法国海滨发现了称为amphoras 的容器。有2500年历史的容器有酒瓶的特点，被位于现在的意大利的伊特鲁里亚人所使用。但是这些amphoras真的用来装酒吗？
Researchers looked at 13 Etruscan amphoras that had been excavated whole in the French coastal town of Lattara, an ancient import-export center. They also examined a limestone platform that looked to have been a wine or olive press.
研究人员查看了13种在法国海滨城市，古代进出口中心Lattara发掘出来的完整的Etruscan amphoras。他们还检查一种石灰岩平台，它看起来像是一个酒或者橄榄压榨机。
Based on chemical analyses, it’s likely that the amphoras contained wine. And the press did not start being used on grapes until decades after the amphoras arrived. These artifacts imply that the Gallic locals first had their wine shipped in and later began the development of their own wine-making techniques—probably using vines also transplanted into the area. Looks like French wine, like Napoleon, is really an Italian import.
基于化学分析， amphoras很可能用于装酒。而压榨机直到 amphoras出现几十年才用于葡萄。这些文物表明Gallic本地人首先用它来装酒，后来开始发展自己的酿酒技术——葡萄树也同时移植到该地区。跟法国酒一样，拿破仑，也是意大利进口的。
