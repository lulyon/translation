Hands-Free Interactive Electronics Still Distract Drivers

不用手的交互电子设备还是会分散开车者的注意力
Are you listening to this podcast while you drive? Then texting your friends about it? Well, don’t do that. The texting, I mean. Because a new study shows that, even if you’re using a hands-free device, sending or receiving electronic messages can prove a major distraction. That’s according to research sponsored by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. [David L. Strayer et al., Measuring Cognitive Distraction in the Automobile]

More and more car makers are equipping their vehicles with gadgets that allow you to interact with electronics, from checking your GPS to updating your Facebook page. And many of these features are increasingly voice-activated, so you can keep your eyes on the road and your paws at 10 and 2. But hands-free isn’t always risk-free.
越来越多的汽车制造商都已经搭载了可以用来与电子设备交互的小器件，从检查GPS到更新脸书页面。许多特性越来越倾向于语音控制，这样可以使得你可以看路和打方向盘。但是，不同手并不意味着没有危险。
Researchers measured drivers’ brain activity as they engaged in common tasks while behind the wheel, like listening to an audio book, talking on the phone or responding to a voice-activated email system. And they found that calling was a challenge, but that corresponding requires serious mental bandwidth, even without the use of fingers. Voice recognition-texting slowed drivers’ reaction times and made them miss seeing things right in front of them. And that kind of miss can lead to a hit.
研究人员测试了开车者的大脑活动，当他们把握方向盘进行习惯任务时，听有声书，打电话或者回语音邮件。他们发现说话是一种挑战，这种反应需要大量的注意力，即便不使用手。语音识别发消息减慢了开车者的反应时间，让他们失去对前方物体的注意力。这种情况可能导致撞车。
