Applause Can Be Contagious

掌声可以传染
Applause is a sign of appreciation after a good performance. Right? Actually, a new study finds that how enthusiastically you clap can be strongly influenced by the volume and frequency of theaudience clapping around you.
掌声是一场精彩表演之后表达欣赏的行为。对吗？实际上，一项新的研究表明，你鼓掌的热情会强烈影响到你周围的观众鼓掌的次数和频率。
To test how applauding behavior spreads in groups, researchers filmed six different sets of university students who were told to clap after listening to an academic lecture.
为了测试鼓掌行为在人群中是如何传播的，研究人员拍摄了六组不同的大学生，他们在听取一场学术讲座之后鼓掌。
The videos showed that people were strongly swayed by other audience members, or even by just one particularly influential clapper. Applause incidents averaged 9-15 claps per person, but would swell to as many as 30 claps solely based on an individual applause leader. The spasm stopped in much the same way: when one person ceased clapping it triggered a larger group dynamic.
拍摄的视频表明，人们强烈地受到其他观众的影响，甚至哪怕只有一个特别有影响的鼓掌者。每个人平均一次鼓掌9-15次，但是可能上升到30次，重要有一个领头鼓掌的人。停止鼓掌的方式也是一样的：当一个人停止鼓掌的时候，它会引发一个大的人群的动态变化。
The study is in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface and is part of a larger effort to understand social behavior and how it can spread within a group. [Richard P. Mann et al., The dynamics of audience applause]
这项研究旨在理解社会行为及其在人群中的传播。the Journal of the Royal Society  [Richard P. Mann et al., The dynamics of audience applause]
So the next time you see a dull performance, remember, the desire to hold back on clapping might be out of your hands.
所以下次当你看了一场无聊的表演，记住，你想要克制住鼓掌的冲动可能并不取决于你自己。
