Cultural Images Affect Second Language Usage
文化意象影响外语的使用方式
Ordinarily, you’d call a pistachio a pistachio. But if you’re, for example, an immigrant from China and you’ve just seen a Ming vase, you might call a pistachio a “happy nut.” Because visual cues can affect language in people with multiple cultural experiences. That’s according to a study in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

通常，你称pistachio 为 pistachio. 但是如果你是来自中国的移民，并且看到一个明代的花瓶，你会称 pistachio为“幸福果”。因为视觉线索会影响有多重文化经验的人的语言。这个结论来自于一项研究 theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. [Shu Zhang et al, Heritage-culture images disrupt immigrants’ second-language processing through triggering first-language interference]
Researchers performed various tests with students who had come to the U.S. from China. In one, the students heard a recorded conversation, in English, about campus life. But some looked at a Chinese face while they listened, while others saw a Caucasian face.
研究人员对来自中国学生进行了多方面的测试。在其中一项测试中，学生听一段关于校园生活的录音。但有的学生听的时候的看一张中国面孔，而其他人看百种人面孔。
The students then spoke about their own lives. And the Chinese-American students who had listened while looking at a Chinese face spoke English more slowly and less fluently than those who listened while looking at the Caucasian face.
学生们随后讲述自己的生活。听的时候看中国面孔的学生，相比其他看百种人的学生，说英语时语速更慢更不流畅。
In another test, when the students were exposed to Chinese icons, they were more likely to translate from Chinese into English literally. Thus, pistachios became “happy nuts,” which is the name in China.
在其它测试中，当学生看中国面孔时，他们更可能会按字面意思从汉语翻译成英语。于是， pistachios变成了“幸福果”，即中国的叫法。
This phenomenon demonstrates that immigrants struggling with a new language can face unusual and unanticipated challenges. And that what you see can affect what you say.
这种现象表明移民在适应一种新的语言时会面临不同寻常的挑战。所见影响所说。
