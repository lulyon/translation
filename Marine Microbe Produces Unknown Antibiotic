Marine Microbe Produces Unknown Antibiotic
海洋微生物产生未知抗生素
Next time you hit the beach, dig your feet into the sand. And consider that your toes might be mingling with the wonder drug of the future: an antibiotic strong enough to combat MRSA, even anthrax. That's what researchers may have found when they dug a few feet into beach sand at Gaviota State Park, near Santa Barbara: a previously undescribed species of Streptomyces bacteria, which pumps out an antibiotic called anthracimycin.
下次当你去海滩，把双脚放沙里。想想你的脚趾可以与未来神奇的药物在一起：一种可以对抗MRSA，甚至炭疽的抗生素。这是研究人员最近在 Santa Barbara 附近的 Gaviota State Park海滩发现的。一种从未发现的链霉菌细菌品种，产生了一种叫做anthracimycin的抗生素。

As you might have guessed, the old-school antibiotic streptomycin also comes from a strain ofStreptomyces bacteria. But researchers say this newly discovered compound is structurally and chemically unique from that other mycin and from all other antibiotics—meaning it could launch a whole new class of drugs.
可能你已经猜到，传统的抗生素 streptomycin也可以由链霉菌细菌族产生。但研究人员表示这个新发现的化合物在结构和化学特性上比其他抗生素更独特——意味着它可以用于制造新药。
Early tests suggest anthracimycin is 25 to 40 times more potent than today's antibiotics at killing anthrax and other germs, in petri dishes at least. And it wiped out MRSA in 90 percent of infected mice. The results appear in the journal Angewandte Chemie.

There's still no evidence the drug works in humans, and this study’s researchers say they won't be involved in human trials. But they're hoping pharmaceutical investigators won't be resistant to the idea.
现在仍没有证据证明该药对人有效，该课题的研究人员表示，他们不会进行人类试验。但他们希望制药者不要抗拒将其用药的想法。
