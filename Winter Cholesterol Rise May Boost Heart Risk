Winter Cholesterol Rise May Boost Heart Risk
冬季的胆固醇升高可能会增大心脏风险
Winter is high time for heart attacks. And while snow shoveling can pose a danger to your heart, the winter heart attack trend holds true in places that never see snow.
冬季是心脏病高发季节。固然扫雪可能对你的心脏造成危害，但其实在一些从来不下雨的地方，冬季的心脏病也高发。
So researchers in sunny Brazil investigated another cardio culprit: cholesterol. They tracked cholesterol levels in a quarter million people living outside Sao Paulo—mostly middle-aged men and women. And they found that levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol, shot up during the South American winter. The change pushed 18,000 people with borderline cholesterol levels over the threshold. The finding was presented at a recent meeting of the American College of Cardiology.

在晴朗的巴西，研究人员研究了另一个罪魁祸首：胆固醇。他们追踪了圣保罗外的以中年男女为主的25万人的胆固醇含量。他们发现恶性胆固醇的含量，在南美的冬天大幅上升。这种变化使得18000人的胆固醇含量接近临界值。研究发表在at a recent meeting of the American College of Cardiology. [Filipe Azevedo Moura et al., Seasonal variation of lipid profile and prevalence of dyslipidemia: a large population study] 
Why the wintertime spike? People tend to exercise less in winter, and to eat more fatty foods. We also get less vitamin D from sunlight—and studies suggest vitamin D may improve the ratio of good to bad cholesterol.
为什么冬季发生？人们通常在冬季锻炼的少，并且会吃更多的脂肪类食物。而且从吸收的阳光合成的维生素D也更少——研究表明维生素D会增加良性胆固醇的比例。
The biggest concern, the researchers say, is that one annual cholesterol check could over or underestimate your actual levels—and have an outsized influence on whether or not your doctor prescribes meds. The study doctors offer their own wintertime prescription: exercise, eat healthy and get more sun. Might keep you young at heart.
研究人员表示，最令人担忧的是，年度的胆固醇检查可能会高估或低估实际的水平——从而外在的影响医生给你开出的药方。研究人员给出他们自己冬季的处方：锻炼，吃的更健康，以及晒太阳。这会使你的心脏更年轻。
