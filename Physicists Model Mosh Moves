Physicists Model Mosh Moves
心理学家给劲舞建模
A heavy metal concert might be a tough place to think about physics, especially in the mosh pit, where some audience members dance violently. But the mosh pit itself is actually an interesting place to find physics in action. And not just force equals mass times acceleration.
一个重金属音乐会可能很难让你想到心理学，尤其是在跳劲舞的场合，观众们也在疯狂舞蹈。但是舞场本身却是心理学应用的有趣的场合。而且并不像力等于质量乘以加速度这么简单。
Metal-loving Cornell researchers analyzed videos of mosh pits and mapped the motion of participants. They found that the collisions of moshers was similar to the motion of molecules in an ideal gas. Mosh dancers can also form what is called a circle pit, where they run collectively in a ring, creating a vortex pattern.
喜欢重金属音乐的Cornell大学额研究人员分析了舞场的视频，然后对参与者的动作进行了绘图。他们发现跳舞者的相互碰撞类似于理想气体的分子运动。跳舞者也可以形成一个圆形场地，他们可以形成一个环，造成一种顶点模式。
The scientists not only modeled mosh and circle pits, they also found how one type of motion transitions into the other. The presented their ongoing work at the American Physical Society's March Meeting. [Matthew Bierbaum et al., Mosh pits and Circle pits: Collective motion at heavy metal concerts]
科学家们不仅建模了劲舞和圆形场地，他们还发现了一种动作是如何变成第一种的。他们的工作即将发表在the American Physical Society's March Meeting. [Matthew Bierbaum et al., Mosh pits and Circle pits: Collective motion at heavy metal concerts]
But why bother to look at mosh pits in the first place? The physicists think their research may also apply to other extreme situations, which could help us understand collective human movement in panics and riots. So I say, rock on.
但是为什么一开始必须查看舞场呢？心理学家们认为他们的研究可能应用到其他极端的情况，这可以帮助我们理解在恐慌和暴乱时人类的群体移动。所以我说，rock on.
