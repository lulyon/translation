Science Tackles Twitter Talents
科学对待推特名人
Justin Bieber has nearly 39 million followers on Twitter—eight million more than the president. But for those of us who aren't as #blessed as Bieber, researchers have come up with a few tips to racking up more followers—based on an analysis of over 500 active tweeters and their half million tweets, over a 15-month period.
Justin Bieber在推特上有近3900万粉丝——比总统还多800万。但是对那些不像Bieber这样幸运的我们，研究人员想出来一些方法来涨粉丝——基于500名活跃的推特用户以及他们15个月的近百万微博的分析。
First, stop talking about yourself. Timely, informative tweets are 30 times more effective at snagging new followers than tweets about your pancakes. Sophisticated language also attracts followers, even within the short format. 
首先，停止谈论自己。实时的，有内容的微博比谈论自己会更有效的吸引粉丝。复杂的语言也能吸引粉丝，即使是非常短的格式。
Since Twitter is a web of very weak social ties—often people you've never met—spare them the bad news about your commute. Negativity drives potential followers away. Being guilty of "hashtag abuse" is another no-no—limit the use of hashtags so that they maintain some value. The researchers presented their findings at the recent Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, in Paris. [C. J.

由于推特是弱社交联系的网络——经常你从来没有见过的人——分享自己的坏消息。负面性赶走了潜在的粉丝。过度使用井号也不好——限制井号让他们维持原有的价值。研究结果发表在 recent Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, in Paris. [C. J. Hutto, Sarita Yardi and Eric Gilbert, A Longitudinal Study of Follow Predictors on Twitter]
Of course, one recent report claims that half of Bieber's followers are actually fakes, like spambots—and he gets most of his real followers simply for being famous. To increase your Twitter fan base, you have to actually be interesting.
当然，最近一篇报道显示，Bieber的粉丝实际上是假的，就像垃圾邮件机器人一样——出名，就可以充分利用真正的粉丝。为了增加你的推特粉丝基础，你必须真的有趣。
