Computers Can't Show You the Monet（莫奈，画家）
No surprise: machines and humans have differing opinions about art. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute and the University of Girona had computers and non-art expert humans place each of 275 paintings into one of 11 artistic periods, for example, Baroque or Surreal. And, unlike in chess, people far outshone their silicon competitors. That’s according to a study in the journal Computers & Graphics.
并非出人意料：机器和人对艺术的观点是不同的。the Max Planck Institute 和the University of Girona的研究者让计算机和非艺术专家的人把275幅画分别放到11个艺术时期（如 Baroque or Surreal）中。和国际象棋中不一样的是，人远远超过了他们的硅竞争者（指计算机）。这个结果来自 journal Computers & Graphics 中的研究。
Computer algorithms judged the art by obvious and quantifiable parameters, such as the way the paint was laid on the canvas, or the color composition. But humans classified art based on complex psychological evaluation. We ask questions such as, who is in the image? And, what emotions are being portrayed in the scene? This kind of analysis is crucial for correctly identifying art—because even non-expert people were right two thirds of the time, far better than their computer competitors. And that makes sense: ultimately, art is about our emotional reaction to a Starry Night or a Girl With A Pearl Earring. But to a computer it’s all just brushstrokes.
计算机算法通过明显的和量化的参数，如画在画布在分布的方式或者颜色组成，来判断艺术。但是人却是基于复杂的心理评价来给艺术分类。我们会问这样的问题，图中的人是谁？场景中阐释了什么样的情感？这种分析对于正确的艺术分类非常重要——因为即使非专家的人在三分之二的时候也是对的，远远优于他们的计算机竞争者。于是：艺术最终是关于人类情感对事物的反应，如闪耀的夜空，戴着珍珠耳环的女孩。但是对于计算机来说，它仅仅是一些笔画。
