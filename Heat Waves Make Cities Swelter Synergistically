Heat Waves Make Cities Swelter Synergistically
热浪使得城市群相继遭受酷暑
No wonder it’s gonna be a hot time in the old town tonight. Cities can be anywhere from 2 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than nearby countryside, due to what’s known as the "urban heat island" effect. But when heat waves roll through, they interact synergistically with the urban heat island—boosting temperatures even higher than you might expect.
难怪古城的晚上非常炎热。城市的任何地方都比附近郊区高2-20度，由于所谓的“城市热岛”效应。但是当热浪侵袭时，他们跟城市热岛协同——导致超出预期的更高温度。
Researchers used a June 2008 heat wave in Baltimore as a case study. They compared temperatures downtown to those near the Baltimore/Washington International Airport—a residential, half-forested area. Using modeling software, they found that temperatures downtown weren't simply a sum of the urban heat island and the heat wave—they were three and a half degrees hotter than that. The results appear in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology.

研究人员使用2008年六月的Bltimore作为研究案例。他们比较了城市中心和附近的Baltimore/Washington 国际机场附近——一个宜居半森林覆盖的地方。使用建模软件，他们发现城市的温度不是城市热岛和热量的总和——而是比总和还高出3.5度。结果发表在the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology.

Urban areas are carpeted in asphalt and concrete, which don't hold water like soil and vegetation do. So while the countryside sweats during a heat wave, cooling itself through evaporation, the city just bakes. But researchers say there's a simple solution to beat the heat: install green roofs, and plant some trees. Which would help the concrete jungle live up to the second half of its name.
城市由沥青柏油以及钢筋混凝土覆盖，所以不会像土壤和植被一样蓄水。所以郊区遭受热浪时，可以通过水蒸气来散热，城市就不行。但是研究人员表示，有一个简单可行的方法：安装绿色屋顶，以及植树。这会使钢筋混凝土丛林不辜负丛林的名字。
