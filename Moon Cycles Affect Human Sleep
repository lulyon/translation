Moon Cycles Affect Human Sleep
月球周期影响人类睡眠
The lunar cycle affects the night sky, the tides and even the fertility of certain marine species. And it turns out, we can add your shuteye to the list. According to a new study, humans sleep poorly on nights near a full moon. The work is published in the journal Current Biology.

月球周期影响夜空，潮汐甚至海洋生物的繁殖。并且，它还影响你的睡眠。一项研究表明，人类在近满月时睡眠较差。这项工作发表在the journal Current Biology. [Christian Cajochen et al., Evidence that the Lunar Cycle Influences Human Sleep]
To test the moon's effect, 33 adult volunteers of both sexes and various ages spent several nights in a sleep lab. As they dozed, researchers monitored their brain activity, eye movements and hormone levels. On nights closer to a full moon, the subjects took an average of five minutes longer to fall asleep, and slept for 20 minutes less. In addition, brain activity decreased by 30 percent during the sleep stage that the brain normally uses to recover from its daylight work. And levels of melatonin, the hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles, dropped.
为了测试月亮的影响，33位成人志愿者，不同性别，不同年龄，在睡眠实验室度过数晚。当他们瞌睡时，研究人员监测他们的大脑活动，眼球移动以及激素水平。在近满月的夜晚，实验对象需要多才能五分钟入睡，并且睡眠事件少20分钟。另外，睡眠阶段大脑活动减少30%。并且 melatonin激素水平也下降了。这种激素帮助管理睡眠周期。
On these nights, the sleepers complained of poor sleep quality even though they were unaware of the lunar cycle. On the bright side, not a single participant turned into a werewolf. In this cohort.
在这些夜晚，睡觉者抱怨睡眠质量低，虽然他们没意识得到月球周期的影响。好的方面是，没有参与者变成狼人。
