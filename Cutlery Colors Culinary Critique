Cutlery Colors Culinary Critique
餐具颜色烹饪评论

That spoon sure looks yummy. Not that I'm planning on eating my utensils. But the appearance and feel of cutlery influences the taste of food. That’s according to a study in the journal Flavour.[Vanessa Harrar and Charles Spence, The taste of cutlery: how the taste of food is affected by the weight, size, shape, and color of the cutlery used to eat it]
这一勺看起来非常好吃。我不是准备吃餐具。但是餐具的外观和感觉影响食物的口味。这个结论来自于一项研究: journal Flavour.[Vanessa Harrar and Charles Spence, The taste of cutlery: how the taste of food is affected by the weight, size, shape, and color of the cutlery used to eat it].
It was already known that plate size, background music and even lighting can influence eating habits.
人们已经知道盘子大小，背景音乐，甚至灯光都可以影响饮食习惯。
To test the effect of cutlery, researchers served food with utensils of different weights, colors and shapes.
为了测试餐具的影响，研究人员用不同重量，颜色和形状的餐具提供食物。
When volunteers ate yogurt from lighter spoons, they rated its taste as denser and more expensive. Spoon color was important as well. A blue spoon made white yogurt taste less salty than the same yogurt dyed pink. And a black spoon made both yogurts taste less sweet.
当志愿者使用更小的调羹吃酸奶时，他们评价它的味道为更浓厚的，更昂贵。调羹的颜色也很重要。蓝色的调羹可使白色而非粉色的酸奶吃起来更淡。黑色的调羹使酸奶吃起来没那么甜。
Researchers also fed subjects cheddar cheese, who said that eating from a knife made the cheese seem saltier than eating from a fork, spoon or toothpick.
研究人员还实验了切德干酪，发现用刀具比用叉子，调羹或牙签吃起来更咸。
Clearly, outside cues can have a huge influence on how food tastes, and thus on our eating habits. Which may color your choice of place settings at your next dinner party.
显然，外观的暗示对食物的口味有巨大的影响，以至于影响了我们的饮食习惯。这也许会影响你对下次晚餐派对环境的选择。
