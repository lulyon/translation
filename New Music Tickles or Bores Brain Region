New Music Tickles or Bores Brain Region
新音乐愉悦或者压抑大脑区域
When you hear an unfamiliar tune, how do you wind up either tapping your foot or plugging your ears? A study finds that a specific brain region gives the song a thumbs up or down. The research is in the journal Science. [Valorie N. Salimpoor et al.,Interactions Between the Nucleus Accumbens and Auditory Cortices Predict Music Reward Value]
当你听到不熟悉的音乐，你是会拍脚还是会塞上耳朵呢？一项研究发现，一个特定的大脑区域会给歌曲顶或倒。研究发表在 the journal Science. [Valorie N. Salimpoor et al.,Interactions Between the Nucleus Accumbens and Auditory Cortices Predict Music Reward Value]
As 19 subjects listened to samples of unfamiliar songs, their brains were scanned with a functional MRI machine. After hearing each clip, the subjects could bid between zero and two dollars to purchase the song. And the values participants assigned to songs were associated with activity in the nucleus accumbens, a section of the brain's pleasure center. For more popular tunes, this region was more active and communicated more with the brain region that stores auditory information.
19个实验对象听不熟悉的歌曲样本，他们的大脑接受MRI机扫描。听每个片段之后，实验对象可以出价零到两元来买歌曲。参与者赋予歌曲的价值与nucleus accumbens的活动相联系，这是大脑愉悦中心的一个区域。对于更流行的音乐，这些区域更活跃，与大脑存储音频信息的区域沟通的更多。
The scientists think the nucleus accumbens, which helps set expectations, draws on stored musical knowledge to predict how a new tune will play out. When the music fulfills or even exceeds these expectations, the listener feels rewarded. So your listening history helps determine whether you’ll like a new song—or tell it to hit the road.
科学家们认为nucleus accumbens,帮助建立期望，基于存储的音乐知识来预测新的音调。当音乐满足或超过了期望，听者会觉得得到了回报。所以你的听音乐的历史会帮助你决定你是喜欢一首新的歌曲——还是想把它丢在一旁。
