Strong Habits Kick In under Stress
压力之下强习惯有效
When we’re stressed out, self-control can flag. And so we might, say, reach for a candy bar instead of an apple. But California psychologists wondered: what if when we’re stressed ？we fall back on habits, whether good or bad.
当我们压力很大时，自制力会减弱。然后我们可能吃糖而非苹果。但是加州的心理学家想弄明白：如果我们压力山大呢？我们会回到习惯，无论好坏。
The researchers conducted a battery of tests. In one, students rated the strength of their habits regarding breakfast choices and whether they read a section of the newspaper. And they reported their actions during stressful exam weeks. In another test, MBA students were offered healthful or sugary snacks before or after exams. And they rated how frequently they usually ate those types of snacks.
研究人员进行了一系列测试。其中一组，学生评估自己对早餐和读报的习惯选择。他们会在紧张的考试周报告他们的行为。另一组测试中，MBA学生在考前考后被提供了健康或含糖的小吃。他们评估了自己吃习惯食物的频率。
The scientists found that when the subjects’ willpower was depleted, they fell back on habits. If they usually read a section of the newspaper or ate cereal, they clung to their default during the exams. If they usually ate a doughnut, they did so even more frequently when stressed.The research is in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. [David T.

科学家们发现，当对象的意志力减弱，他们回回归习惯。如果他们经常读报或吃燕麦，在考试时他们也会这么做。如果他们经常吃圈饼，当他们感到压力时会吃的更多。该研究发表在 Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. [David T. Neal, Wendy Wood and Aimee Drolet, How do people adhere to goals when willpower is low? The profits (and pitfalls) of strong habits]
The finding could mean that if you habitually grab fruit for a snack, you’ll likely keep doing so, especially, when stressed. One less thing to get stressed about.
这个发现意味着如果你习惯于吃水果，在感到压力时，可能会一直吃。一种舒缓压力的方式。
