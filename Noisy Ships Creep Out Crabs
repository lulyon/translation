Noisy Ships Creep Out Crabs
喧嚣的船吓坏螃蟹
A relaxing day at the beach. Then suddenly the peace is shattered—by the sound of ships. It can sour your mood. Now a study in the journalBiology Letters finds that noisy ships make crabs crabby, too. [Matthew A. Wale, Stephen D. Simpson and Andrew N.

海滩上轻松的一天。突然船的声音打破了平静。它会坏了你的心情。一项研究发现，喧嚣的船也会使螃蟹变得暴躁。[Matthew A. Wale, Stephen D. Simpson and Andrew N. Radford, Size-dependent physiological responses of shore crabs to single and repeated playback of ship noise]

Researchers exposed different-sized shore crabs to either ship noise or ambient harbor noise.  The crabs that contended with the annoying ship sounds had higher metabolic rates than did their companions, an indicator of stress. And the larger crabs were put out the most.
研究人员把不同大小的海蟹置于船声或者轻松的海港噪声之下。跟吵闹的船声一起的螃蟹比其它同伴新陈代谢速度更快，新陈代谢速度是压力的指标之一。较大的螃蟹尤其如此。
Stressed crabs burn calories faster, which can stunt their growth in fisheries. Stressed wild crabs with increased appetites might need to travel to expand their feeding grounds, which raises their risk of running into predators.
紧张的螃蟹卡路里消耗更快，这会阻碍他们在渔场的生长。紧张的野生螃蟹会增大食欲，并且可能扩大它们的捕食范围，这也增加它们被捕杀的可能性。
The research suggests that crabs aren’t the only sea-dwelling species peeved by the noise, either. Companies are exploring ways to design quieter ships, in the hope of offering crabs and other marine life some peace and quiet.
研究人员认为，螃蟹并非唯一受噪声影响的海生物种。许多公司在探索方法来开发低噪声的船，目的是还螃蟹以及其它海洋生物一个平静的栖息地。
