闭上眼睛时恐怖音乐更恐怖 Scary Music Scarier With Eyes Shut

Scary music plays a key role in ramping up the fear factor in movies. The soundtrack has such an effect that I put my hands over my ears during the most frightening moments. Now researchers at Tel Aviv University report that scary music is even scarier if you shut your eyes.
恐怖音乐在电影中制造恐怖气氛方面起着重要作用。电影配乐作用非常强以至于我们会在最恐怖的时候用手捂住自己的眼睛。现在Tel Aviv大学的研究者报告说，如果你闭上眼睛，恐怖音乐会显得更加恐怖。
In research published in the Public Library of Science ONE, they say this effect may lead to new ways to treat neurological diseases. Volunteers listened to Hitchcock-style music twice: once eyes open and once eyes shut. With eyes closed, their amygdalas lit up. That’s the region of our brains that processes emotions. Volunteers said they also felt the emotional effects of the music much more in the dark.
Science ONE的公共图书馆发布的研究指出，这种效应会催生治疗神经病的新方法。志愿者听两次Hitchcock风格的音乐：一次睁开研究，一次闭上眼睛。闭眼时，他们的扁桃体活动加快。这是我们的大脑用来处理情感的区域。志愿者表示他们在黑暗状态上会更加强烈的感到这种情感作用。
Scientists say shutting our eyes might synch up different brain activities, allowing our brains to “better integrate the highs and lows of the emotional experience.” The researchers hope that these findings could lead to music-based therapies for conditions like depression and schizophrenia.
科学家指出闭上眼睛可能同时激发了不同的大脑活动，以使我们的大脑“更好的整合情绪体验的高低起伏"。研究者希望这些发现能够催生对抑郁症和精神分裂症的音乐疗法。
As for me, during some of those scary movie scenes, music does sneak through my hands into my ears—good thing I leave my eyes open.
至于我，在有些恐怖电影场景中，音乐的确通过我的手潜入我的耳朵里——幸运的是我睁着眼睛。
