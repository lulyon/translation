Sensation Seekers Stomach Spicier Sustenance
寻找刺激的人喜欢辣的食物
The more adventurous the risk-taker, the hotter the wings. That's according to a study presented at the 2012 Institute of Food Technologists Annual Meeting in Chicago. [Nadia Byrnes and John Hayes, Personality May Predict If You Like Spicy Foods]
越喜欢冒险的人，他吃的鸡翅就越辣。这个结论来自一项研究presented at the 2012 Institute of Food Technologists Annual Meeting in Chicago. [Nadia Byrnes and John Hayes, Personality May Predict If You Like Spicy Foods]。
Researchers assessed 184 participants using the Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking, a test for how much a person desires novel and intense stimulation and risky behavior.
研究人员使用Arnett寻找刺激测试（Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking）评估了184位参与者，它用于测试一个人对于新奇紧张的刺激和冒险行为的渴望。
The subjects were then given food kicked up with capsaicin, which puts the heat in chili peppers. They were asked to rate how much they liked the spicy meal as the burn from the compound increased.
测试对象被提供了包含辣椒素的食物，而热量都包含在辣椒粉里。随着配料的增加，他们会评估自己对辣的食物的喜好。
Those volunteers who rated high on having a sensation-seeking personality continued to enjoy the meal as the burn intensified. Non-sensation seekers couldn’t take the heat and eschewed rather than chewed. A third group of mild thrill seekers did not like the spicy meal either, but not nearly as much as those with risk-averse personalities.
那些性格上比较喜欢寻找刺激的人随着热度的增加会持续享受这些食物，而不喜欢寻找刺激的人则相反。第三类人则居中。
The researchers say that people who enjoy risky behavior including gambling or thrill rides might be getting the same kind of danger rush when biting into a hot pepper. Just be sure to digest all that spicy food before hitting the roller coaster.
研究人员表示，那些喜欢赌博或骑马的人在嚼一口辣椒时，可能会陷入某种危险。在坐过山车之前，先消化到自己吃的辣的食物吧。
