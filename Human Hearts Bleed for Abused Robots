Human Hearts Bleed for Abused Robots
人心为虐待的机器人流血
Can your heart bleed for a robot? In two experiments, people reacted to videos where a human appeared to either torture or coddle one of three subjects: another human wearing green, a small green robot, or an inanimate green box. And viewers had a definite emotional response to the treatment of the robot. The work will be presented at the International Communication Association's annual conference.
你的心会为机器人流血吗？在两个实验中，人们观看了人类拷打或照顾三种对象的视频：穿绿色衣服的人，小的绿色机器人，还有一个绿色的盒子。观察者对机器人的对待情况有特定的情感反应。这项工作将发表在the International Communication Association's annual conference.

Forty volunteers watched clips of the robot, which reacted to abuse with upset crying and choking noises and to affection with happy purring and babbling sounds. Viewers became physically agitated watching the abusive video, and afterwards they reported a negative emotional response.
四十位志愿者观看了机器人片段，机器人被虐待时，他们会哭或抽泣；而在机器人被优待时，他们会表现的非常欢快。观看虐待视频时，观察者非常不安，看完之后，表现出负面情绪。
In the second experiment 14 people watched the videos while undergoing a functional MRI brain scan. The scans revealed similar responses when either the robot or the human received affection. But the human's apparent abuse caused more concern than the robot's.
在第二个实验中，14个人在观看视频时接受MRI脑部扫描。扫描反映了类型的表现。但是对人类的虐待比机器人会引起更多的同情。
Understanding our emotional response to robots may help inform the development of robotic assistants. In the meantime, be nice to your Roomba.
理解我们对机器人的反应，可以给机器人助理的发展以启示。同时，对你的机器人好点。
